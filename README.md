Hello there!  
This is the Ene-Bot. She's basically a clone of the NadekoBot.   
But Ene has a changed Source and a custom Music Module! :o  
  
Notice: Do not download this Bot, it won't work and I only want to show,  
how some stuff actually works. If you want to self-host Nadeko, take  
a look here: [Click me](http://nadekobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#content)
